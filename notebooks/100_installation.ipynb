    "[Python](https://www.python.org) It is a multiplatform programming language, which means that it runs on all major operating systems, but differs slightly depending on its version. Therefore, some considerations should be kept in mind when installing. In general terms, to develop in Python we must have the following elements:\n",

    "For this course, we chose to simplify the installation procedure to focus on the code. The separate installation of the Python interpreter, an IDE and all the packages we will use, can be a confusing task if the development ecosystem is not clear. As the course progresses, more detail of these elements will be given..\n",
