    "This section discusses briefly the workflow on Github, in a situation when a repository has many collaborators. For more details see [this link] (https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) of the Github site, which includes a more beautiful version of the diagram and a detailed explanation of each part of the process.\n",

    "The main branch, called **master**, only contains proven and concluded advances. Every time we want to apply a new advance or idea in a repository we create a **branch** on which we test the new modifications. **Commits** are made within the branch, and when we consider that we have finished with the progress in which we were working we make a **pull request**. This causes a discussion about the progress with the collaborators and the owner/administrator of the repository. The latter can accept the 'request' and add the advance to the 'master' branch through a **merge**.\n",

    "* Locate within the branch to make changes there: `git checkout main-screen`\n",
